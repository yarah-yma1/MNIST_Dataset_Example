# Implementation
The models implementation consists of an input of the MNIST dataset in which it involves a collection of 70,000 handwritten digits (0-9), with each image being 28x28 pixels. The model is trained using 25 EPOCHs in which it is passed through 25 times, with a validation split of 0.2 to prevent overfitting and validates on a specific portion of the data. 
# Requirments 
This project requires tensorflow, keras, and scikit-learn. It was developed using a Python environment through VSCode.

Use 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install the following dependencies:

```
tensorflow==2.20.0
keras==3.11.3
scikit-learn==1.7.1
```
# How to Use
To utilize this code, a Python environment is installed. Download the MNIST.py file onto your computer into a folder. Then open that folder/file on VSCode. 
# Error Handling 
This project does not have any error handling.
